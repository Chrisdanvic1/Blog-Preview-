## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, custom properties, responsive techniques)  
- A mobile-first approach to layout  

### What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of:

- Structuring content with semantic HTML  
- Centering and spacing with Flexbox  
- Applying shadows, border radius, and hover effects  
- Using media queries to adapt to smaller viewports  

Example of a CSS hover effect I used:

```css
.title:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  transition: color 0.3s ease;
}
